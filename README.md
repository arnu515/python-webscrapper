# Webscrapper build using Python
Uses beautifulsoup4 and requests. Scrapes data from flipkart and stores it in a `.csv` file.

### How
First, clone the repository and `cd` into itusing `git clone https://github.com/arnu515/python-webscrapper.git && cd python-webscrapper`.  
Now, type:  
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```  
*You can also use a venv if you want*

After it installs, type `python3 app.py` and let it load. It will create `data.csv` which contains all the scrapped data.
